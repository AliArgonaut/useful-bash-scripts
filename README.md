# A Collection of Useful Bash and Python Scripts

1. vita-mix : generate opinionated vite projects with tailwind and shadcn
2. Dot-Up-Pckgs : fetches updated AUR and Pacman package lists, timestamps them, and puts them in a named dotfiles directory for git tracking and easy reinstalls
3. Spring-Jar : builds and runs maven and gradle projects given the root directory of a module
4. html-to-pdf : combines a variety of tool options for creating pdf files from markdown files
5. vita-nest : a souped up vita-mix. I find that I don't use the -r option, but I would like a -b option for generating typescript backends, so I swapped -r for 
-b
